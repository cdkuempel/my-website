Hi, thanks for visiting my site. I am current a post-doctoral scholar at the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (UC Santa Barbara). As part of the "Comparing the Environmental Impacts of Global Food Systems" working group, my research is focused on synthesizing, quantifying and mapping the environmental impact of food production across land and sea.

In 2018, I recieved my Ph.D. in Conservation Science for the University of Queensland, where I identified shortfalls of current protected area strategies in reaching conservation goals and developed novel metrics and solutions to help achieve protected area objectives within international conservation targets (e.g., Aichi Target 11). I also had the opportunity to teach classes and workshops in spatial conservation planning using the Marxan software and consulted with several major non-governmental organisations in developing spatial conservaiton plans.

Additionally, I earned a master's degree in coral reef ecology at Northeastern University and undergraduate degrees in Environmental Science and French at the University of Iowa.
